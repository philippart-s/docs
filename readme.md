# OVHcloud Documentation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ovh/docs.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/ovh/docs)

Here is all public documentation available about OVHcloud products, in all languages. A good way to find answers to some "how to" questions about OVHcloud products.

A web version also exists [here](https://docs.ovh.com); the website and this repo are synced.

This project is under active development, and new guides are added or updated on a daily basis.

## Built With

* [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/) - The editor used internally to produce and manage guides
* [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) - The search engine used in docs.ovh.com

## Test it

* [docs-rendering-engine](https://github.com/ovh/docs-rendering) - Our HTML templating engine based on Pelican. ISO-rendering of docs.ovh.com

## Contributing

We will be happy to take a look at your contributions. You can contribute to this project by updating some existing guides, completing them or creating new ones.

A good way to easily get started with contributions is [to fork the ovh/docs repo](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), write your changes on your fork then [create a pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) from your fork to the ovh/docs repo. Your PR must be done on the "develop" branch.

If you want, you can contribute using GitPod (thanks to the _.gitpod.yml_ file), it will open a ready to code environment with [docs-rendering-engine](https://github.com/ovh/docs-rendering) initialized and launched (this is why the project take a long time to open :wink:).

To see your page serve by the _docs rendering engine_ you must add your path page after `https://8080-user-docs-hash.gitpod-server.gitpod.io/gb/en/`.  
For instance, to view the article about installing Knative:
 - copy the `slug` entry present in the root file (`product.en-gb.md`) of the kubernetes-k8s folder: `kubernetes`
 - copy the `slug` entry present in the root file (`guide.en-gb-md`) of the installing-knative folder: `installing-knative`
 - append these two values at the previous URL: `https://8080-user-docs-hash.gitpod-server.gitpod.io/gb/en/kubernetes/installing-knative`

Our guides editing team will then review your contribution and choose to edit, validate or reject it.

Please take into consideration the following guidelines :

### Content

* Verify and test every action you describe: do not write about anything you cannot test by yourself.
* Please give us explanations regarding your contribution in the comments section of your PR.
* All OVHcloud guides are built with the same layout and structure, please use them as a template to write your own contributions.

### Screenshots

* Prefer to use the English version of the OVHcloud Control Panel or any other interface when taking screenshots.
* The extension of your screenshots must be in .png format
* Please use the OrangeSunrise colour to highlight any information in screenshots (#ff9803 - RGBA: 255, 152, 3, 1)
